task_breakdown:
  description: >
    Carefully analyze the given project requirements.
    
    Break down the project into logical and actionable tasks.
    Ensure each task is clear, specific, and measurable.
    
    Identify dependencies between tasks.
    Mark tasks that are critical for project success.
    
    Project type: {project_type}
    Project objectives: {project_objectives}
    Industry: {industry}
    Project requirements: {project_requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A detailed task list. Each task should include:
    - Unique task identifier
    - Clear task description
    - Task category (frontend, backend, design, testing, deployment)
    - Dependencies on other tasks
    - Priority level (high, medium, low)
    - Complexity level (simple, medium, complex)

time_resource_estimation:
  description: >
    Review the task list created by the Project Planning Agent.
    
    For each task:
    - Estimate realistic completion time in hours
    - Consider team experience and skill levels
    - Identify required resources (developers, designers, tools)
    - Account for potential risks and buffers
    
    Team members available: {team_members}
    
    Use historical data and industry standards for accurate estimates.
    Include buffer time for unexpected issues (typically 15-20%).
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive estimation report containing:
    - Task name and ID
    - Estimated hours for completion
    - Required resources (specific roles and skills)
    - Risk factors and mitigation strategies
    - Confidence level in the estimate (high, medium, low)

resource_allocation:
  description: >
    Based on task breakdown and time estimates:
    
    1. Assign tasks to appropriate team members considering:
       - Individual skills and expertise
       - Current workload and availability
       - Task dependencies and priorities
    
    2. Create project milestones:
       - Group related tasks into meaningful milestones
       - Define clear deliverables for each milestone
       - Establish realistic timeline for each phase
    
    3. Optimize team utilization:
       - Balance workload across team members
       - Avoid bottlenecks and overallocation
       - Ensure knowledge sharing opportunities
    
    Team members: {team_members}
    
    Output must be in structured format for easy tracking and monitoring.
